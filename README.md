# Bacom-Blog
The Franklin based project for the business.adobe.com blog. Based off of milo-college.

## Developing
1. Install the [Helix CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli): `sudo npm install -g @adobe/helix-cli`
2. Run `hlx up` this repo's folder. (opens your browser at `http://localhost:3000`)
3. Open this repo's folder in your favorite editor and start coding.

### Husky Pre-Commit
1. After pulling the main branch, make sure to run `npm install` to get the husky pre-commit package.
2. Husky will run the linter before your commit, and will fail if the linter fails. 
3. To bypass this, add the `--no-verify` flag after your commit message. e.g. `git commit -m "First" --no-verify`.

## Testing Milo Changes on Bacom-Blog Pages
1. Run 'hlx up' in this folder to ensure the bacom site is running locally. 
2. Make changes in milo, and then from the milo folder, run `npm run libs`.
3. Milo will run at:
```
http://localhost:6456
```
4. On your `localhost:3000/` or the `main-<project>-<owner>` versions of your site, add the URL params: `?milolibs=local`
5. You should see milo changes occuring on bacom pages.
6. When needing to test on a bacom page while making a PR for milo, add the URL params: `?milolibs=<name-of-milo-branch>`to your test URLs.

## Creating New Blocks
When creating new blocks, first vet any requirements/author-experience in milo-community. There may be a way to acheive your goals with what currently exists in milo. 

## Testing
```sh
npm run test
```
or:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
This will give you several options to debug tests. Note: coverage may not be accurate.
